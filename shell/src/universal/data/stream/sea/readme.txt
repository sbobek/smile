sea.arff - dataset with 4 'SEA' concepts as described in (Street and Kim, 2001)
sea_tst1.arff,
sea_tst2.arff,
sea_tst3.arff,
sea_tst4.arff - 4 datasets with test data for each concept

hyperplaneX.arff - datasets with the rotating hyperplane
with different parameters of drift; see (Fan, 2004):
1: k=2, t=0.1
2: k=2, t=0.5
3: k=2, t=1
4: k=5, t=0.1
5: k=5, t=0.5
6: k=5, t=1
7: k=8, t=0.1
8: k=8, t=0.5
9: k=8, t=1

Remark. There was an error class labeling in sea.arff file. The
error was corrected.
